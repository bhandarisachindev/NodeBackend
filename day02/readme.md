# app.js Overview

The `app.js` file is the main entry point for many Node.js applications using the Express framework. It sets up the server, configures middleware, and defines routes.

## What is Express?

[Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. It provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications, such as:

- Routing: Define URL paths and HTTP methods.
- Middleware: Functions that execute during the request-response cycle.
- Template engines: Render dynamic HTML pages.
- Error handling: Manage errors gracefully.

## Example `app.js`

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;



// Routes
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Express!');
});

// Start server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

## Key Points

- **express()** creates an Express application.
- **app.get()** defines a route for GET requests.
- **app.listen()** starts the server.

Express simplifies server-side development in Node.js by handling common web application tasks efficiently.
