# 📦Project Overview

> 🛠️ This is a basic Node.js backend project setup.  
> It's just the beginning — the structure will expand as we build the project throughout the course!

## 🧠 File/Folder Descriptions

| File/Folder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `src/db/db.js` | Handles database (likely MongoDB) connection using Mongoose or the native driver. |
| `server.js` | The main server file that initializes Express and connects to the database. |
| `package.json` | Defines dependencies (e.g., Express, Mongoose) and project settings. |
| `package-lock.json` | Auto-generated file that locks exact versions of all dependencies. |
| `text.txt` | Optional or temporary test file — safe to remove if unused. |

## ✅ Next Steps

As we progress, the project will grow to include:

- `routes/` → Define Express routes
- `controllers/` → Business logic
- `models/` → Mongoose schemas (for MongoDB)
- `middlewares/` → Custom middleware (auth, validation, error handling)
- `utils/` → Helper functions
